# Zero to Mastery Hacktoberfest 2022 Project - ASCII Art Web App

## What is this?
This folder contains some code for a Flask web app that allows the users to upload
an image (either `.jpeg`, `.jpg`, or `.png`) and produce the ASCII art version of it
on the webpage.

## What can you do?
There are so many improvements that can be made to this web app (for starters,
it's kind of ugly, not gonna lie), so please, let your creativity flow.
As said in the main repository: there are no wrong answers here.

## Installation
Install the necessary dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt` (if using macOS or Linux, you might need to do `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`).

If you need to install new libraries for this web app, just add their name in the
`requirements.txt` folder.

## Running the App
In your command line, run `flask --app ascii_art --debug run`

### Have Fun!
